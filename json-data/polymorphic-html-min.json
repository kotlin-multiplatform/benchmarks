The hardware is getting faster all the time; I'd be complaining vocally if I'd bought the version from earlier this year to use for rendering work, simply because the improvements in the graphics architecture generation-over-generation deliver a big performance leap for certain types of work. And it unsurprisingly remains an excellent combination of design, performance and battery life."}},{"type":"p","data":{"text":"The MBP 16 has the same design as the previous model, which was launched in early 2023 and has been the same since 2021, so you've probably already seen it. I won't rehash my thoughts on it, since they haven't changed either; if you're curious, read my review of the <a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/tech/computing/m2-pro-macbook-pro-16-review-apple-peps-up-its-creative-workhorse/\">early 2023 model MacBook Pro 16</a>.

And that's the primary way to justify the price, especially for the $3,999 (£4,099, AU$6,899) configuration I tested. Apple continues to stress workstation application and gaming performance -- ray tracing and mesh shaders were a couple of the big additions to the graphics processing with the M3. But there still aren't many high-profile games available and Apple's list of upcoming games doesn't impress. As a game designer, you could make a case for it, though you'll probably still design for other platforms first."}},{"type":"p","data":{"text":"Now that there's a 15-inch MacBook Air, though, you've got a more reasonably priced option -- well, reasonably priced compared to the MacBook Pro 16 -- compared to the entry price of $2,499 for the MBP 16."}},{"type":"p","data":{"text":"The base configuration comes with the 12-core CPU/18-core GPU version of the M3 Pro processor, with 18GB RAM and 512GB SSD. That should be fine for a lot of nonprofessional or social pro photo editing, but it's not great if you're looking for more than just a big HDR screen. If you're performing tasks that justify the outlay for the laptop, you likely need at least 1TB SSD, and would probably benefit from upping to 36GB RAM. That bumps the price to almost $3,100."}},{"type":"geekbox_chart","data":{"chartName":"Apple MacBook Pro 16 (M3 Max, late 2023)","headingRows":"","chart":[["Price as reviewed","$3,999,  £4,099, AU$6,899"],["Display","16-inch 3,456x2,234 254ppi 14:9/16:10 aspect ratio; 500 nits SDR, 1,600 nits HDR"],["CPU","Apple M3 Max 16 cores (12P/4E)"],["Memory","48GB LPDDR5"],["Graphics","Apple M3 Max integrated 20 cores"],["Storage","1TB Apple SSD AP1024Z, SD card slot"],["Ports","USB-C/Thunderbolt 4 x3, HDMI 2.1, 3.5mm audio"],["Networking","Wi-Fi 6E (802.11ax), Bluetooth 5.3"],["Operating system","MacOS Sonoma 14.1"],["Weight","4.8 lbs/2.2kg"]]}},{"type":"p","data":{"text":"Going all-out with the configuration, with an M3 Max (16 core CPU/40 core GPU) 128GB memory and an 8TB SSD will run $7,199, which is a lot to swallow and excessive for the components, at least on paper. But yay! Apple delivered on the higher memory maximum of 128GB, which was a nitpick I had with the last model.<br><br>One nice thing, though, is that performance for Apple's CPUs is consistent across the lines, meaning the same chip delivers roughly comparable performance in a similarly equipped Mac Mini as it does in a MacBook Pro. On one hand, It would be nice if you got better performance on more expensive hardware, but the consistency makes buying decisions a little easier.

It's now available in space black instead of space gray, as well as silver, and it incorporates anodized aluminum on the cover to resist fingerprints and smudges; that's not a new idea, but it's not very common yet. It works fairly well, but it sometimes seems like it's not actually getting smudged less, but the smudges just aren't as visible from certain angles.

But it also (as with everything) depends on what you're doing. No matter what you'll get a significant bump in multicore performance thanks to the individual increases in single-core speed. But, for instance, Geekbench 6 CPU tests reflect general usage, while Cinebench concentrates specifically on rendering. General-purpose GPU computation, as reflected by Geekbench's Metal test, didn't increase much, going from 38 old cores to 40 new ones.
